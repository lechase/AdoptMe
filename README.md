# AdoptMe
The Adopt Me Pet Adoption GitHub repository is a collaborative project aimed at creating an open-source platform for facilitating pet adoptions. This repository serves as a central hub for developers, designers, and animal lovers to contribute to the development of a web application that connects prospective pet owners with adoptable pets.
